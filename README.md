# windows-95
Welcome to my retro-themed hackathon project! Step back in time with a Windows 95-inspired webpage that brings a nostalgic twist to modern apps like Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and Amazon. The interface mirrors the classic desktop design, complete with clickable, fully responsive "windows" for each application, delivering functionality wrapped in vintage aesthetics.

I created this project to merge the charm of retro computing with the digital platforms we use every day, adding a playful, human touch to the experience. Every detail, from the layout to the responsive design, was crafted with care to make you smile. Explore, interact, and enjoy the blend of nostalgia and modern tech. Dive in and have fun!
